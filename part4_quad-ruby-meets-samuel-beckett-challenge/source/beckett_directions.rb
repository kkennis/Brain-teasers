# Arguments:
#   +actors+ is an arbitrary array of unique elements, representing
#   the totality of actors that could possibly appear on stage
#
# Return values:
#   Returns an +Array+ of +Arrays+, each of which represents
#   the set of actors on stage at each moment in time
#
# Rules:
#   1. Each subset of actors, including the "empty" set, should appear
#      in the returned array once and exactly once
#
#   2. Each consecutive set of actors should differ by *either*
#      the removal or addition of a single actor, representing
#      that actor entering or exiting the stage, respectively
